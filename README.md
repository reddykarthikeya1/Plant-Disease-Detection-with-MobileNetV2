I’ll share my journey of developing a deep learning model that detects plant diseases using transfer learning. The model leverages MobileNetV2 — a lightweight yet powerful architecture pretrained on ImageNet — to achieve high accuracy even with limited data. By following along, you’ll learn not only how to implement the code step by step but also why transfer learning is such a game-changer in computer vision.
